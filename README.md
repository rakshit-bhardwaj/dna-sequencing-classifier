A genome is a complete collection of DNA in an organism. All living species possess a genome, but they differ considerably in size. The human genome, for instance, is arranged into 23 chromosomes, which is a little bit like an encyclopedia being organized into 23 volumes. And if you counted all the characters (individual DNA “base pairs”), there would be more than 6 billion in each human genome. So it’s a huge compilation.


A human genome has about 6 billion characters or letters. If you think the genome(the complete DNA sequence) is like a book, it is a book about 6 billion letters of “A”, “C”, “G” and “T”. Now, everyone has a unique genome. Nevertheless, scientists find most parts of the human genomes are like each other.


As a data-driven science, genomics extensively utilizes machine learning to capture dependencies in data and infer new biological hypotheses. Nonetheless, the ability to extract new insights from the exponentially increasing volume of genomics data requires more powerful machine learning models. By efficiently leveraging large data sets, deep learning has reconstructed fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. It has become the method of preference for many genomics modeling tasks, including predicting the influence of genetic variation on gene regulatory mechanisms such as DNA receptiveness and splicing.
